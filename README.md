# moodycron

A cron with an attitude, personality and stamina.

Available personalities:
* eager
* energetic
* lazy
* slow
* tired


How to run:

```
./moodycron <PERSONALITY>
```

It reads jobs from a cron file, runs them, then falls asleep. If you enable the feature `dreams`, the program will tell you a dream they had during sleep. This feature requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and the [tinydolphin](https://ollama.com/library/tinydolphin) model.

Do not use it anywhere. I am just playing with Rust.
